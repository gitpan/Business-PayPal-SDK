Revision history for Perl extension Business::PayPal::SDK.

0.14 Fri Dec 9
  - fixed not returning RefundTransactionID in RefundTransaction

0.13 Wed Dec 7
  - Added RefundTransaction
  - Standardized all responses. Previously some functions returned undef when they should have returned a hash of paypals response.
  - All functions now return a hashref with $ret->{ack} set to whatever paypal returns. Also the hashref should contain an "ErrorCodes" element which should be just an empty hash ref on ack 'Success'
  - Beter protected java calls with eval. If there is in error with most java calls now, functions will return undef and set the $self->error method.
  - Fixed various other bugs.

0.11 Mon Nov 14
  - Fixed version to be 3 digits.
  - Added DoDirectPayment.
  - Changed the response from functions when there is an error.
  - Added test script, its just a compile test as anything beyond that would require knowing where the paypal_java_sdk is.
